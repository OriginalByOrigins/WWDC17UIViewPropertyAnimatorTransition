# WWDC17UIViewPropertyAnimatorTransition

Inspired by ![WWDC 2017 Animation Session](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/230/), I created this app that uses *UIViewPropertyAnimator* to drive the animation.<br />
There are several animations during the transition, each has a different timing function:

* Animate the comment section view
* Animate blending of a 2 label (small and big) ```Comments```
* Animate cornerRadius of top-left and top-right corner.
* Animate the blur effect which positions over the rootViewController's mainView

#### The animation transition is interruptible and interactive
